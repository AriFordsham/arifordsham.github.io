*"My knowledge is a collection of things I am able to learn, which happen to have already been useful to me in the past."*

Knowledge is not accrued by itself - Knowledge serves as a showcase of an individual's *ability to learn.* Chances are, if someone already knows subjects well, they will be able to learn any subject they put their mind to.
