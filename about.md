### ðŸš§ Under constuction!

*"My knowledge is a collection of things I am able to learn, which happen to have already been useful to me in the past."*

Knowledge is not accrued by itself - Knowledge serves as a showcase of an individual's *ability to learn.* Chances are, if someone already knows subjects well, they will be able to learn any subject they put their mind to.

I pride myself in my ability to ask intelligent questions, mine the information available to me - practically limitless in today's world, - find the relevant data, think hard to make sure I *understand,* Satisfy myself that I have the full answer, and repeat.

I like to have the answers to the following questions:

* Why is something done a certain way?

* Everybody does it that way. Is that for [*essential* or *accidental*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet#Summary) reasons?

* What other ways are people doing it? Why? Why isn't everyone else?

* What other ways can I think of, that would solve the problem? Will they work? Is anyone doing anything similar? If not, why not?

My main area of interest is computer science. I regularly read textbooks and academic papers, and have, at different points in time, had interest in the following areas:
